- Fall 2023
- **Location**: Online
- **Time**: At your own pace
- **Prerequisites**: None

--------------------

## Schedule Fall 2023

We will utilize the lab Slack channel #workshop to engage in a series of online courses, as well as to review relevant books and materials. This approach will allow us to enhance our fundamental computational skills essential for our work in the lab.

### Basic Computational Skills with `HPC`

#### Week 1 (Aug 28): Linux Command Lines
- Learn about Linux Command lines and shell scripting (about 2 hours)
  - [edX: Learn Linux Command Line](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-programming/edx-try-it-learn-linux-command-line?index=product&queryID=647e638ac5fe8dfcc9aa9d7a1395004d&position=3&linked_from=autocomplete&c=autocomplete)
