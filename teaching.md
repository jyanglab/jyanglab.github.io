### 2024

- __Spring 2024__: __[ANS/AGRO-931](/agro931): Population Genetics__
  - In this classical population genetics class, students will build on the theoretical concepts to develop breeding strategies for plant and animal improvement. Those who work with natural populations will also get the necessary principles to understand variation and to develop strategies to maintain the genetic variation.


- __[PopGen Module]()__: a three week module to go through some basic concepts in population genomics
  - __Module 1__: [[HTML](https://jyanglab.com/slides/2024-module/week1/w1.html)]
  - __Module 2__: [[HTML](https://jyanglab.com/slides/2024-module/week2/w2.html)]
  - __Module 3__: [[HTML](https://jyanglab.com/slides/2024-module/week3/w3.html)]  

-----------------------

### FALL 2023

- __LIFE-891-003: Complex Biosystems Seminar__
  - __Course Objectives__: The purpose of this course is to introduce you to the ongoing and exciting research in our community, as well as give you the opportunity to share your research with others.   

- __[Computational Genomics Workshop](/workshop2023)__
  - This is an informal lab workshop. We will utilize the lab Slack channel #workshop to engage in a series of online courses, as well as to review relevant books and materials. This approach will allow students to enhance the fundamental computational skills essential for our work in the lab.

### Spring 2022

- __[ANS/AGRO-932](/agro932): Biometrical Genetics and Plant Breeding__
  - The goal of this course is to apply biometrical methods to connect the phenotypic traits with high-dimensional genomic data to better understand polygenic traits for both prediction (or plant breeding) and inference (for gene mapping) purposes.
