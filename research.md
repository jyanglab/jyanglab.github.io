## 1. Improving maize NUE through Omics innovations

Synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizer is one of the most expensive and energy-intensive
inputs to produce in agricultural production systems worldwide. Inefficient use of N fertilizers in agriculture
leads to a host of environmental and economic concerns. To alleviate the environmental burdens and
increase farming profitability, it is critical to identify sustainable alternatives to improve crop NUE. 
In my group, we aim to improve NUE from the genomics, phenomics, and microbiomics perspectives.

### 1.1 NUE through Genomics Innovation



In the past decades, the genetic gain through continuous
hybrid releases from public and private sectors has contributed substantially to the yield improvement. 
Prior to the 1960s (old-era) in the U.S. Corn Belt, the selection primarily occurred in N-limited
agricultural systems. Since the 1960s or post the Green Revolution (new-era), as inorganic N fertilizers
became increasingly available, maize selection has been mainly conducted in systems where N was
not the limiting constraint on productivity or yield. The shifted N condition has changed the breedersâ€™
preference to select hybrids with high planting density to take advantage of higher rates of N fertilizers,
resulting in a number of physiological and morphological changes in maize. 
However, to what extent the shifted N conditions have reshaped the genomic architecture and regulatory networks in affecting the N assimilation and mobilization has not been systematically studied.
Here, we aim to reveal the genomic changes during recent maize improvement in the oversupplied conditions and validate the functional consequences of these genomic changes.

### 1.2 NUE through Microbiome Innovation



Plant roots are colonized by thousands of microbial species that can improve plant health and performance, such as solubilization of nutrients, competition with pathogens, phytohormone production, and N fixation. Harnessing these beneficial microbes in maize cropping systems provides an attractive opportunity to reduce dependence on chemical N fertilizers.
Our study suggested that the plant host selecting the beneficial
microbes predominantly through negative selection (a form of natural selection to select against
mutations that are deleterious to fitness), resulting in low allele frequencies of the deleterious mutations
across the host genome.
The plant hosts preferentially selected beneficial microbes to provide promising targets for in-depth investigation of the symbiotic relationship, especially the microbes for promoting NUE. 
Here, we will harness the beneficial microbes for maize NUE study from both the plant genetics and plant-associated microbiome perspectives.

### 1.3 NUE through Phenomics Innovation



In collaboration with several colleagues in phenomics, my group has started to expand the research area on high throughput
phenotyping (HTP), with a focus on in-field phenotyping using
unmanned aerial systems (UAS). Over the years, we have collected UAS imagery data on several
maize diversity panels. To analyze these image data, we developed a UAS image processing pipeline
to extract clipped plot-level images and then apply pixel filtration algorithms to remove the non-foliage
elements.
In the future, we will continue to develop methods to extract physiological and morphological traits (i.e., tassel detection using machine learning methods) from UAS-based imagery data and use these data to map genes and facilitate plant breeding.

### Genetic mechanisms underlying heterosis



[Heterosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosis) or hybrid vigor is a phenomenon that hybrids performance better than both of the inbred parents.
Heterosis is of substantial importance to crop improvement but its genetic basis remains controversial. 
Population genetic theory has long argued that heterosis can be explained largely by complementation of recessive deleterious alleles, but this model is inconsistent with evidence from polyploid hybrids that suggests an important role for gene dosage. 
Our [published work](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007019) has shown that a model of incomplete dominance both fits predictions of population genetic theory and explains empirical results from polyploids. 
The long-term interest of the lab is to enhance the heterosis prediction for future breeding.

With extensive [genome-wide association study (GWAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study) experience, our lab has started to expand to the area of high throughput phenotyping, emphasizing on downstream genotype-phenotype association study. 
In collobration with the [Schnable Lab@UNL](http://schnablelab.org/) and [Yufeng Ge Lab](https://engineering.unl.edu/bse/faculty/yufeng-ge-1/), we sought to characterize the phenotypic traits by using machine vision technology, i.e. unmanned aerial system (UAS) and LemnaTec high-throughput phenotyping system in the [Greenhouse Innovation Center](https://innovate.unl.edu/greenhouse-innovation-center). 
We are interested in estimating the genetic parameters, i.e. polygenicity (number of non zero effect SNPs), selection pressure, magnitude of effects, SNP-based heritability etc., in controlling various phenotypic traits extracted from high throughput phenotyping.
