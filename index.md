__Our lab focuses on quantitative genetics and statistical genomics of maize and its wild relatives, from historical domestication to future improvement.__

As our primary study system, maize is not only an essential crop that feeds the world’s growing population but also represents a promising system for studies of population and quantitative genetics. 
Domesticated from its wild ancestor teosinte (meaning “the grain of the gods”) about 9,000 years ago, ancient farmers had taken about 5,000 years to convert the bushy grass producing hundreds of thumb-length ears to the plant
recognized as modern corn that adapted to the wide environmental conditions. 
Starting from the early 19 century, modern breeding has dramatically reshaped plant morphology, especially with the broad
application of inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilizer in maize production. 
Therefore, the ancient domestication and recent improvement processes can be considered case studies to understand plant adaptation.


__We are currently focusing on the below  major research areas (see [research page](/research/) for more details)__: 
 - Improving maize N use efficiency through Genomics, Microbiome, and Phenomics innovations
 - Evolutionary and Functional Genomics
 - Statistical modeling to bridge genotype to phenotype divide
