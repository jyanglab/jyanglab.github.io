__Our lab focuses on quantitative genetics and statistical genomics of maize and its wild relatives, from historical domestication to future improvement.__
Domesticated from its wild ancestor teosinte (meaning “the grain of the gods”) about 9,000 years ago, ancient farmers had taken about 5,000 years to convert the bushy grass producing hundreds of thumb-length ears to the plant recognized as modern corn that adapted to the wide environmental conditions. 
Starting from the early 19 century, modern breeding has dramatically reshaped plant morphology, especially with the broad application of inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilizer in maize production.

__We are currently focusing on the below  major research areas (see [research page](/research/) for more details)__: 
 - Improving maize N use efficiency through [Genome](), [Phenome](), and [Microbiome]()  innovations
 - Evolutionary and Functional Genomics
 - Statistical modeling to bridge genotype to phenotype (G2P) divide
