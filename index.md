Our lab is using the economically important crop maize as our study system to address the overarching question of __how to leverage wild ancestors to improve domesticated crops, especially under stress conditions__ (i.e., low nitrogen). 

To do so, our lab is focusing on bridging the __genotype-phenotype (G2P) divide__ during maize domestication processes by using quantitative genetics/genomics and statistical modeling approaches, specifically studying the mode of inheritance of genetic loci in determining complex traits, such as grain yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE).

At a broader scale, we are keen to integrate various large-scale biological datasets such as phenomics, genomics, transcriptomics, methylomics data and functional annotations to boost the power of **Genome-wide Association Study** and **Genomic Selection**.

Our lab's major interests (see [research page](/research/) for more details) include: 
 - Studing **methylome evolution** in reshaping the patterns of the gene regulation in domesticated crops
 - Using **quantitative and population genetics** approaches to understand the genetic architecture of agronomically important traits, and how **deleterious alleles** shape the patterns of plant adaptation.  
 - Exploring the **genetic basis of heterosis** and predicting hybrid performance by incorporating biological annotation information.  
 - **Collecting and modeling complex phenotypes**, such as molecular phenotypes, time series phenotypes, or phenotypes obtained via image analyses, and understanding the molecular mechanism controlling for plant development.
